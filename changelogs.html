<p>Thank you for choosing Bloxstrap and for supporting its development. ðŸ˜Š</p>

<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.7.0</h2>
    <h3>Additions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Localization has been fully implemented! By default, it follows your system language, but you can manually choose one in the Bloxstrap Menu's appearance tab too. Massive thank you to all the translators who contributed!</li>
        <li>In the flag editor, the JSON import utility now allows you to easily import from a file.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to easily disable the configuration of any Fast Flags (intended for troubleshooting purposes).</li>
        <li>Added the ability to use unsupported Roblox app languages.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to easily open Roblox's current log file through the activity tracker menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Existing Changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On version upgrade, the new release notes now open in a webpage instead of just a notification popping up.</li>
        <li>The prompt to confirm second instance launching is now optional, being disabled by default.</li>
        <li>Bootstrapper styles have now been given more sensible names.</li>
        <li>The presets section of the Fast Flags tab has been given a complete refresh, with loads more options, and fixes for problematic presets.</li>
        <li>A proper error message is now shown for downloads that failed verification.</li>
        <li>Functionality for custom integrations has been vastly improved, with the added ability to specify files instead of only executables, applications now launching with the same working folder as the executable's location, and a file picker dialog.</li>
        <li>Exception dialog message now makes reference to the Wiki, telling you to read it first before opening an issue.</li>
        <li>Improved readability of the menu alert bar (#2219).</li>
        <li>Scroll bars in the Bloxstrap Menu are now always shown.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed inconsistent handling of desktop app closing for "Don't exit to desktop app" integration.</li>
        <li>Fixed performance bug with the activity tracker (which was also contributing to the above issue).</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with installation erroring if the given path had a lowercase drive letter (thank you @cryolithic!).</li>
        <li>Fixed BloxstrapRPC not working under certain foreign system locales.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with JSON exporter in the flag editor erroring when copying to the clipboard.</li>
        <li>Fully implemented flag editor validation, now validating flag types and values too.</li>
        <li>Added handler for if a log file cannot be written (#2135).</li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.6.1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed the Git hash being included in the version number. That's a recent .NET change that I forgot to account for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.6.5</h2>
<h3>Additions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>New launcher styles! Now being closer to the contemporary Roblox launcher, especially the new Mac launcher.</li>
    <li>If you launch Roblox while you're already in a Roblox game, you'll be prompted for confirmation so that you don't close your existing game by accident (#606).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Existing Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The flag for Bloxstrap FPS unlocking is now not set unless necessary.</li>
    <li>Menu footer now follows Windows 11 Mica colouring.</li>
    <li>The "Disable desktop app" mod option is now the "Don't exit to desktop app" integration. This also fixes the issue of Roblox crashing when exiting a game. Activity tracking is required for this to work.</li>
    <li>Big scary warnings have been added to the Fast Flag editor. Spooky. If you're confused as to where it is, it's at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Saving your changes in the menu is now non-destructive, and does not close it anymore.</li>
    <li>Activity tracker information fetching is now more efficient.</li>

    <li>Having a custom font configured on first installation no longer causes the install process to error.</li>
    <li>Fixed permission errors when trying to remove a custom font.</li>
    <li>Added support for recent changes in Roblox's deployment system which was causing those "403 (Forbidden)" errors that forced me to release this in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Removals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Multi-instance launching has now been removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed selected escape menu version not applying when choosing either V1 or V2.</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.5.2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug with an "access is denied" error sometimes being thrown when launching Roblox.</li>

    <li>Fixed selected channel sometimes not applying.</li>
